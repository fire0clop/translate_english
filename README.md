# translate_spain
This is my second python project.Besides the project itself, my goal is also to train my skills in python programming using database and django, as well as skills in html, css, js. Goal of project: The goal of this project is to create a web application that will help me and other people to learn a language faster (at this stage of the project development the main language is Spanish).Link for test: http://translate0spain.pythonanywhere.com/


History: For me, the biggest challenge in learning languages is vocabulary. And to store the studied words, to repeat and type them I need an application. Some words get lost if you use writing utensils, some are forgotten and in general such use is not as effective as an electronic dictionary with a personal set of words.

Differences from other applications: I know that such applications on the Internet is an incredible number and perhaps many of them will be realized much better than my project, but almost all of them are paid and some lack features that would facilitate the use of such services. Therefore, I decided to make this application solely according to my views on the usability of such a program

The main points I want to realize in this application are as follows:

1)a person can type a word in Russian and the program will automatically link it to the Spanish translation and immediately add the word to the user's personal dictionary.

2)Since foreign words can have several translations, i.e. one word in Russian can have a translation for several different words in Spanish, I will add the ability to edit or enter a word in Spanish yourself.

3)grouping of words as they are learned. each word has ranks, that is, for example, if a person has already learned a word, it is moved to the learned folder. This will help not to repeat repeatedly already learned words

4)Repetition of words will be implemented on the system of errors, that is, if the translation of a word a person makes a mistake often, it is found more often so that a person has the opportunity to learn it better and vice versa if a person for 20 hits has never made a mistake, the word is found less often

5)sets of words. Generate sets of words according to their belonging for example if a person wants to learn a set of fruits, he can add words from this set to his set in one click

6)enhanced possibilities in repetition (listening and pronunciation)* the realization of this function is an addition to the

7)In the future, I would also like to add German for study
